					<h3>Family Life Program</h3>
				</div>

				<p>The Family stands at the core of the Knights of Columbus’ beliefs and ideals.&nbsp; Councils should encourage families to make time to enjoy each other’s company, talk and be active together.&nbsp; Efforts to ensure families remain strong and viable will be a gift passed on to future generations.&nbsp; Encourage members and their families to choose the Holy Family as their model of interdependence, sharing and respect for other.&nbsp; Every council should invite all families to become involved in parish and community activities.</p>

<h3>Family of the Month</h3>
<p>The “Family of the Month” recognition program is designed to honor one family each month for service to church, community and their council.&nbsp; Every council should select one of their deserving families, document their efforts on the form found in the Family of the Month CD and present them with a certificate of recognition (Form #1843) at a Mass they normally attend or at a council family activity.&nbsp; To allow the family to be recognized by the Supreme Council, submit this form to the Supreme Council Department of Fraternal Service before the 15th of the following month or complete it online at <span id='eeEncEmail_IAZOidzUHK'>.(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)</span><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/var l=new Array();var output = '';l[0]='>';l[1]='a';l[2]='/';l[3]='<';l[4]=' 103';l[5]=' 114';l[6]=' 111';l[7]=' 46';l[8]=' 99';l[9]=' 102';l[10]=' 111';l[11]=' 107';l[12]=' 64';l[13]=' 119';l[14]=' 119';l[15]=' 119';l[16]='>';l[17]='\"';l[18]=' 103';l[19]=' 114';l[20]=' 111';l[21]=' 46';l[22]=' 99';l[23]=' 102';l[24]=' 111';l[25]=' 107';l[26]=' 64';l[27]=' 119';l[28]=' 119';l[29]=' 119';l[30]=':';l[31]='o';l[32]='t';l[33]='l';l[34]='i';l[35]='a';l[36]='m';l[37]='\"';l[38]='=';l[39]='f';l[40]='e';l[41]='r';l[42]='h';l[43]='a ';l[44]='<';for (var i = l.length-1; i >= 0; i=i-1){ if (l[i].substring(0, 1) == ' ') output += "&#"+unescape(l[i].substring(1))+";"; else output += unescape(l[i]);}document.getElementById('eeEncEmail_IAZOidzUHK').innerHTML = output;/*]]>*/</script>.&nbsp; The council should also submit a copy of the Family of  Month form to the State Family Life Director. The Supreme Council will randomly select 100 families on the 15th of each month from the forms submitted. Those winners will receive a Holy Family Gift along with a letter congratulating them from our Supreme Knight.&nbsp; Councils should publish the winners in their parish bulletin and council newsletter with the family’s permission.</p>

<h3>Family of the Year</h3>
<p>Every council should select a “Family of the Year” from their monthly winners, complete the form in the Family of the Month Booklet and submit it to their District Deputy no later than March 10th. He will select a District winner from the entries received from the councils in his district and submit the entry to the Diocesan Judge no later than March 20th. Winners will be recognized at the State Convention in May.&nbsp; The State Family of the Year application will be forwarded to the Supreme Council for the International Family of the Year competition.</p>

<h3>Family Activity of the Year</h3>
<p>Each Council should prepare a scrapbook containing photos and a detailed description of a favorite Family Activity. Submit the scrapbook to the Family Life Director by April 1. Three scrapbooks will be chosen from these entries to be recognized at the State Convention. The one judged best will be forwarded to Supreme for consideration in national awards.</p>

<h3>Knights of Columbus Family Week</h3>
<p>Each Council should hold some type of Family Activity such as a breakfast, picnic or dinner to show their appreciation for their member families during Family Week. See the calendar of events for the dates in August.</p>
