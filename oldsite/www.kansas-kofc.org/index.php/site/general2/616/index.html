					<h3>Free Throw Contest Rules</h3>
				</div>

				<p>The following information was taken from the October 11, 2001 Program Supplement to the Knightline, official publication of the Knights of Columbus.</p>

<h3>Competition Authority</h3>

<p>The Knights of Columbus Free Throw Championship will be under the authority of the State Deputy and State Youth Director. Questions about this program should be directed to the appropriate state official or to the Supreme Council Department of Fraternal Services, 1 Columbus Plaza, New Haven, CT 06510-3326, Telephone: (203) 772-2130.</p>

<h3>Eligibility and Entry Requirements</h3>

<p>Boys and girls between the ages of 9 to 14 are eligible to compete in the Knights of Columbus Free Throw Championship.</p>

<p>Age eligibility is determined by the age of the contestant as of January 1. Proof of age is required. High school-age athletes should be advised to check with their school athletic directors or their high school athletic associations regarding possible eligibility conflicts.</p>

<p>Each youngster may compete in only one council competition. Local champions may not represent more than one council.</p>

<p>Championship entrants compete against youngsters of the same age and gender in six age divisions: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. At the council level, each competitor gets 15 free throws, and the one who makes the most wins. If there&#8217;s a tie, five-shot tiebreaker rounds follow until a winner emerges.</p>

<p>All contestants must register using the K of C Free Throw Championship Entry Form/Score Sheet (#1598). All entry forms/score sheets must include a parent&#8217;s signature. Proof of age must accompany all registration forms and should be verified at the council level.</p>

<p>The entry form/score sheet also contains spaces to record the contestant&#8217;s score. This form must accompany each champion as he or she progresses through the competition. In the event that the winner in any level cannot participate in the next level of competition, the second-place winner should represent the area for that group.</p>

<p>No participants should be allowed to attempt their free throws at a special time, other than the scheduled and publicized hours of competition.</p>

<h3>Free-Throw Championship Rules</h3>

<p>The standard rules for basketball free throws apply at all levels of the Knights of Columbus Free Throw Championship competition.</p>

<p>Free-throw violations include stepping on or over the foul line prior to the ball reaching the rim and shots that rebound into the basket support structures or equipment that is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Contestants may not enter more than one council competition.</p>

<p>Each contestant receives three warm-up shots. At council-level competition, contestants get 15 free-throw attempts. At district, regional or state competitions, contestants get 25 free-throw attempts.</p>

<p>Recommended specifications for age groups include:</p>

<p>Boys and girls age 9-11- Shoot from a foul line 12 feet away from a 10-foot-high basket. That is three feet closer to the basket than a regulation foul line: The line should be clearly marked with athletic or masking tape. Also, a women&#8217;s regulation-size basketball should be used.</p>

<p>Boys age 12-14 - Shoot from the normal foul line 15 feet away from a 10 foot-high basket. Use a men&#8217;s regulation-size basketball.</p>

<p>Girls age 12-14 - Shoot from a normal foul line 15 feet away from a 10 foot-high basket. Use a women&#8217;s regulation-size basketball.</p>

<p>Tip: Check with your state or provincial high school athletic association regarding regulation-size men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s basketballs.</p>
