				<h3>State Deputy's Message</h3>
			</div>
			
				<h3>April 2017</h3>
				<p>In just a few weeks, we will meet in Topeka for the 116th Kansas State Convention!&nbsp; The Convention is and will always be a great time to renew old friendships and to celebrate the achievements of the fraternal year.&nbsp; It looks we’ll have many things to celebrate:&nbsp; new records in tootsie roll donations, a record amount of Religious Education monies raised, the installation of two sonogram machines in pregnancy crisis centers, and the installation of two new Knights of Columbus Councils! I was looking at the State membership numbers and I realize that we are doing much better this second half of the year.&nbsp; Kansas hit its membership goals for both January and February.&nbsp; It is hoped that by the time you read this, Kansas will have achieved its goal for March, also.</p>

<p>Now… about April, May, and June: membership is one great big momentum machine.&nbsp; Once a Council or a District becomes membership active, don’t stop!&nbsp; You’ve got to keep it going!&nbsp; It is much easier to keep your First Degree Team sharp if you have more than one or two degrees a year.</p>

<p> I would like to remind you that the coveted Star Council award can still be achieved.&nbsp; As if being recognized by Supreme as one of the top 10% of Councils in the entire Order was not enough incentive, Supreme offers an even bigger prize:&nbsp; if a council qualifies for the Star Council Award in 2016-2017 Fraternal Year, that council will receive a credit for the 2017-2018 Fraternal Year of $4.50 for each billable member on the roster as of July 1st, 2017! That’s right!&nbsp; If your council has 100 billable members on your roster, your council will receive a $450 credit from Supreme towards, per capita, culture of life, etc.!&nbsp; If you are close on the membership requirement, get busy!&nbsp; Schedule a couple of First Degrees and recruit to fill them.&nbsp; If you lack membership make certain that your Field Agent know this and encourage him to work your Council’s new and/or Associate Members.&nbsp; If you don’t have a Field Agent, make certain that you contact your General Agent for help.</p>

<p>A little reminder if your Council or District is considering Star status:&nbsp; suspensions and withdraws count against your membership numbers.&nbsp; What is the best way to keep these suspensions and withdraws from occurring?&nbsp; Recruit members, get them to the 3rd Degree, and then involve them in Council functions. If a member has not paid his dues or stops coming to Knights of Columbus meetings, contact him.&nbsp; Find out what is going on.&nbsp; Invite him back to meetings.&nbsp; Remind him of the benefits of membership in the Order.&nbsp; Most of all, doing nothing will get you nothing.</p>

<p>As we approach the end of Lent and Easter Sunday, I wish all Knights and their families a happy and joyous Easter!&nbsp; May the love of God, family and friends nourish your soul, and renew in us all a sense of God’s love.</p>

<p>Vivat Jesus</p>
