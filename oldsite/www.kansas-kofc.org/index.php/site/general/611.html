					<h3>Commitment to Humanities</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Each October, you see the Kansas Knights in front of Churches, stores and other places offering a candy bar for a donation. Over the past few years the candy bar has been Tootsie Rolls. (NOTE:Tootsie Roll does not donate the candy&#8212;the Knights purchase each and every roll for wholesale prices).</p>

<h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
<p>The Kansas State Council of the Kansas Knights of Columbus is THE prime sponsor of the Special Olympics Basketball Tournament held each March at Fort Hays State University in Hays, Kansas.&nbsp; Each year over a thousand of special Olympians proudly compete and bring home honors from Hays, Kansas.&nbsp; The donations we receive for the candy bars funds this event and as well as programs for people with intellectual disabilities in the four dioceses of Kansas.</p>

<p>Each child of God, regardless of their physical abilities, has intrinsic worth. The Kansas Knights of Columbus proudly offer their hard work so these athletes can compete and enjoy themselves in the Special Olympics. Funds are also given each year to the four bishops of Kansas to use in programs for people with intellectual disabilities and those with special needs.</p>

<p>Next time you see one of the Kansas Knights offering you a Tootsie Roll or some other candy bar, give a nice donation&#8212;it goes to a very worthy and needed cause.</p>
