					<h3>Pennies from Heaven</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Once again it is time to start our fund raising efforts to help support EDAP(Emergency Disaster Aid Program). These funds must be replenished so we can continue to help people in their time of need. The Pennies From Heaven funds provide the major support for EDAP. EDAP is designed to provide immediate help to people who have had material losses to their homes caused by natural disasters (fire, flood, tornado, etc.). These funds are available for any needy family. Additional information concerning EDAP can be found by clicking <a href="500/index.html" title="EDAP Information">here</a>.</p>

<p>The suggested goal for each council is, &#8220;ONE PENNY PER DAY PER MEMBER.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the inside back cover of the official state directory you will find the rules for obtaining aid from the EDAP. The funds that are donated by the local council will be credited to your council&#8217;s total donation to the Pennies From Heaven Program. </p>

<h3>Convention</h3>
<p><b>ARTS, CRAFTS, BAKED GOODS:</b> Councils are asked to bring NEW OR HAND MADE items to sell in the general store. All money collected will be credited to the council donating these items.</p>

<p><b>SUPREME PROMOTIONAL ITEMS AND GIFTS</b> Will be in the General Store for sale. </p>

<p><b>COUNCIL DONATIONS:</b> Monetary donations from councils may be turned in at the Country Store during the State Convention any time before noon on Saturday. Recognition of the council with the highest dollar amount per member in each division will be determined after all donations have been collected on Saturday.</p>

<p><b>AUCTION:</b> Items will be chosen for auction at the State Convention. If your council has an item they would like considered for the auction, please let me know ASAP. Auction items will be included in the total dollars from a council.</p>
