<p>The Knights of Columbus Insurance Agency in Kansas has 30 Field Agents working to serve the Knights of Kansas and their families. All of the men wrote $165,631,000 of life insurance protection in 2006.</p>

<p>The three General Agents of Kansas rely on the District Deputies, Grand Knights, and council officers to help in recruiting good quality men for the Field Agent position. Men sought for this position are most probably already employed, self motivated, self starters, leaders in their community and wanting to make a difference in the lives of our members. They may be a farmer, banker, salesman, teacher or self-employed in another field. Regardless of their current field of employment, these men may be looking for a change of careers.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the Supreme Council has offered an incentive to the State and Council officers who have referred a man to us who is eventually hired.This program is called <b>Fist Full of Dollars</b>. In the program, the Supreme office will reimburse any State  or Council officer $200 for the referral and then at a later date they will make a donation to this man&#8217;s council in his name. This $200 is given in <b>gold Sacajawea coins.</b></p>

<p>Please put some serious thought into this matter and give your General Agent a calls as soon as possible with this man&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is asked that the Field Agent assigned to your council be kept well informed as to when a degree or any council function is scheduled. Our agents serve many councils and may not be able to keep up with the activities of each council.</p>
