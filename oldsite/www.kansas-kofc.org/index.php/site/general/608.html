					<h3>Fr. Michael J. McGivney - Cause for Sainthood</h3>
				</div>

				<p>The Congregation for the Causes of Saints appointed a relator, or advocate, to work with Father O&#8217;Donnell in the writing of the positio, or extended argument, for<br />
Father McGivney&#8217;s canonization. The relator is Dominican Father Ambrose Eszer, the chief relator at the Congregation, who has shown a keen interest in Father McGivney&#8217;s cause since the beginning.</p>

<p>The <i>positio</i>, which runs to nearly 1000 pages in two volumes, includes both an historical biography and an essay on Father McGivney&#8217;s spirituality. The <i>positio</i> was presented to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in January 2002. Revisions and additions were submitted later in the spring.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2003, the diocesan phase of the investigation into a reported miraculous cure attributed to Father McGivney&#8217;s intercession was completed. The report was also conveyed to the Vatican Congregation, and the supplementary investigation in the miraculous healing was closed in 2004. One miracle is required for beautification, at which time Father McGivney would be declared &#8220;Blessed;&#8221; another miracle after that declaration is required for<br />
canonization.</p>

<p>In January, 2006, Father Gabriel B. O&#8217;Donnell presented to the Congregation of Saints the final piece of documentation regarding the reported miracle. The next step is granting the title of &#8220;Venerable Servant of God&#8221; to Father Michael J. McGivney.</p>
