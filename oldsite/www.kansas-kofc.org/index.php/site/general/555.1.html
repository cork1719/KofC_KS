					<h3>Council Activities</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Council activities provide the true fraternity that is needed for our councils and Order to grow. They give each member the opportunity to support the council and to fully experience the benefits of Columbianism. Without well thought out and carefully planned activities, councils will not have a successful activity and will not live out the true spirit of our founder, Father Michael J. McGivney.</p>

<p>The State Council has put together a team of dedicated and capable chairmen to assist you in planning and carrying out a successful Council Activities Program. The basic programs are outlined in the Program and Membership Guide and there will be articles in the Explorer and additional details provided by the chairmen throughout the year. Contact any of them for assistance.</p>

<p>Any activity performed by a council is eligible for the outstanding Council Activity Award. As you plan your events for the year, describe them in a scrapbook by collecting newspaper clippings, photographs and other materials. Submit you council&#8217;s scrapbook to the State Council Activities Director by the deadline. The Kansas State Council Service Program Awards will be presented at the State Convention.</p>
