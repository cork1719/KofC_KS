				<p>Some ask what the Knights of Columbus do. The following summarizes some of their many achievements for the benefit of the Church internationally and for all humanity.</p>

<p>With international headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut, membership in the Knights stands at approximately 1.75 million members in 14,000 local units in 70 jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Panama, Cuba, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Poland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * The Knights of Columbus pay the costs of televising and beaming Vatican programs and ceremonies to the T.V. satellites making world wide viewing available for such days as Easter and Christmas (Midnight Mass).</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * Last year our order gave over 125.6 million dollars for charitable and benevolent causes and had over 58 million hours of volunteer service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * Established the Vicarius Christi Fund in the amount of 20 million dollars for Pope John Paul II; the earnings of 2 million dollars each year are given to His Holiness for his personal charities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * Underwrote the renovation of over 150,000 square feet of the facade of St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica and the statues of St. Peter and Paul in the square.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * The Order&#8217;s mortgage loan program for religious institutions is a major source of aid for the construction of Catholic churches, schools and church related facilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * For many years has spread the truth about the Catholic faith through the Catholic Information Service which distributes pamphlets and home study courses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   * Sponsors an annual seminar for all Bishops of North America which brings them up-to-date on the latest medical-moral issues.</p>
