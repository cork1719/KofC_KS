					<h3>Vocation Promotion</h3>
				</div>

				<h3>Adopt-A-Seminarian Program</h3>
<p>The most important goal for all councils, assemblies, and circles is to adopt a seminarian. If you need a new seminarian, names will be suggested to you to assure that all seminarians will be adopted. Some councils may be asked to adopt more than one seminarian or even a seminarian from another diocese, to assure that each will receive an equal amount of donations. All the seminarians are very appreciative of the financial support they get each year, but this is not the only thing that we ask you to do. We want you to send them as many cards and letters that you can. Let your members know your seminarians name and address, so they can contact them personally. These cards and letters of encouragement are very important. It lets them know that you really care about what they are doing. Say the Prayer for Vocations at your meeting for vocations and your seminarian.</p>

<p>Click <a href="../../church/seminarians.html" title="List of semarians in Kansas">here</a> to see a list of all seminarians in Kansas.</p>

<h3>Refund Support Vocations Program (RSVP)</h3>
<p>The Supreme Council encourages councils and assemblies to support seminarians by refunding them $100.00 for every $500.00 donated to a seminarian or postulate. This means that the total $500.00 must go to a single seminarian or postulate. The $500.00 cannot be split up between two or more to qualify for the $100.00 refund. The request form #2863 is in the council report form booklet and posted on the Kansas State Council website. This form must be submitted before June 30. All the official rules are found on the back of the #2863 request form. If your council does not donate the $500.00 to a single seminarian, you still need to fill out this form. If you adopted a seminarian or postulate you are still eligible for a plaque, or the current year plate, to be put on the plaque you already have.</p>

<h3>World Day of Prayer for Vocations</h3>
<p>This day each yeas isbeen designated as world day of prayer for vocations. We would like each council to hold either a mass or say a rosary for vocations on the specified day. Also you may want to invite your seminarian or postulate to talk to the councilor the religious education program in your parish about their calling. The specific date can be found in the calendar of events.</p>

<h3>Vocation Poster Contest</h3>
<p>Vocation posters should be drawn free hand on an 11 inch wide by 14 inches tall paper. The poster is to be drawn vertically. The winning poster from all that are submitted will be printed on the back of the Program and Membership Guide. There will be winners from five different grade levels in each diocese. The grades are 1st &amp; 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th, 5th &amp; 6th, 7th &amp; 8th, and Special Education. On the back of each poster you need to have the student&#8217;s name, address, grade, council number, district number, and diocese. Any poster not having these items listed will be disqualified. We ask that each Grand Knight make sure this information is clearly printed on the back of each poster, so that the child will not be disappointed by a disqualification. The local councils can conduct this contest at any time before March 10th. Council winners must be sent to your District Deputy no later than March 15th. District Deputies must send their winners to the State Vocation Chairman no later than March 25.</p>
