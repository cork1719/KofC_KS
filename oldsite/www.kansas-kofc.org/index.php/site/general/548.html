					<h3>Message from the Kansas Squires Chairman</h3>
				</div>

				<p>&#8220;Esto Dignus,&#8221; Latin for &#8220;Be Worthy&#8221; is the motto of the Columbian Squires, the official youth organization of the Knights of Columbus. The Squires program has helped young Catholic men between the ages of 10 and 18 develop leadership skills, concern for their community and devotion to their Church. What a better way to join in celebrating Fraternalism than to help sponsor a new Squires Circle in your Council?</p>

<p>With all the negative distractions our young men face each day on television, print media, internet and peer groups, developing a Squires Circle could provide an alternative approach. This allows Dads and other concerned men of the Council to spend the quality time needed during these formative years, ages 10 through 18. This small investment of time reaps great benefits not only for the community, but the Church and council as well.</p>

<p>To sponsor a circle, a council needs to provide a meeting place, a Chief Counselor, Assistant Counselors, a Father Prior (provided by the Parish), and 10 young men between the ages of 10 and 18 in good standing with the Church. Think about your Council. Can&#8217;t you picture three men and ten boys that meet the above qualifications?</p>

<p>A new program will allow individual Squires advancement to higher levels of training, involvement and advancement in leadership. There are five new levels of achievement in the &#8220;Squires Advancement Program&#8221; (in order, from least to most challenging): Page, Shield Bearer, Swordsman, Lancer, and Squire of the Body of Christ.</p>

<p>I can assure you the benefits that your Church, Community, and Council will reap will be far greater than any inputs needed to start and run a program in your Council. Please contact me by phone at 785-743-5393 or by e-mail and let me assist you in any way possible to achieve the goals you have set for the young men in your Church. &#8220;ESTO DIGNUS - BE WORTHY&#8221;</p>

<p>Edwin Schmeidler, Jr.<br />
Columbian Squires Chairman</p>
