<p>The success of the Order&#8217;s insurance program is not only the result of sound and prudent business judgment, but is a direct reflection of the fraternal purposes of the Knights of Columbus. The Order&#8217;s conservative approach to its insurance operations ensures the security of its members and their dependents. This conservative approach is reflected not only in the Order&#8217;s business and investment strategy, but also in its traditional life insurance and annuity products and the manner in which they are marketed.</p>

<p>The continued growth of the Order has enabled it to expand not only its insurance program but its benefits to members, charitable contributions, volunteer work and service to the Church and society. In its insurance program, as in all that it does, the Knights of Columbus remains committed to excellence and to the highest standards of ethics and quality. The record bears out this commitment.</p>

<p>Other details about the Order&#8217;s insurance operations are found in the Supreme Knight&#8217;s 2007 Annual Report.</p>
