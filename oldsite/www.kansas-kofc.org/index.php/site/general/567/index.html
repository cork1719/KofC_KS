					<h3>Membership</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Then Jesus Said to his disciples, <i>Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.&#8221; Matthew 16:24</i> </p>

<p>As Christians and members of the Knights of Columbus, we are called to be disciples of Christ. The Supreme Council has chosen our membership campaign theme based on Pope Benedict XVI&#8217;s papal visit to the United States. In pope Benedict XVI&#8217;s words:</p>

<h3>Faith - Family - Fraternity&#8212;Recruit a Knight</h3>
<h3>One Member per Council per Month</h3>

<p>Every time we give an invitation to a good Catholic man to join the Knights of Columbus we are helping build up our church. The Knights with their established programs give us the tools to put our faith into action through our service to Church, Community, Family, Youth, Pro-Life and Council There is Power in Numbers. For us to ignore the vision and zeal of the Venerable Fr. Michael J. McGivney and not offer the opportunity to our fellow man would be a travesty. Thus, it is the <b>obligation</b> of every Knight so <b>ask</b> for members. Let us not forget the Knights of Columbus was formed to protect the Family. The faster we grow our order the more protection is afforded them. This is one of the many ways we Build Up His Church. Let&#8217;s not let Him down.</p>
