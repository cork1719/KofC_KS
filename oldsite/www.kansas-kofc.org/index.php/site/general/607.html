					<h3>Fr. Michael J. McGivney Guild</h3>
				</div>

				<p>The Order of the Knights of Columbus has established The Father McGivney Guild to promote the cause for canonization of our founder, Father Michael J. McGivney. The goal of the Guild is to spread the good word about his holiness of life, to encourage devotion to his memory, and to seek his intercession before the throne of God. The Guild serves as a clearinghouse for information about Father McGivney, his life and works, and any favors attributed to his intercession. </p>

<p>Father McGivney is a unique model for today&#8217;s Catholic and today&#8217;s Catholic priest because of his attention to the social ills and injustices of his day and his collaboration with the laity. He was zealous for the life of union with God through prayer and the sacraments, and he would have been right at home in today&#8217;s world. He was then and would be today an eager apostle for the Gospel of life, and a determined foe of the culture of death.</p>

<p>Membership in the Guild is open to anyone who wishes to share in this mission of making known the life and work of Father McGivney and of encouraging devotion to his memory All one need do is go to the <a href="http://www.fathermcgivney.org/mcg/index.do" title="Fr. McGivney website">Fr. McGivney website</a> and fill out the application and submit it. There is no charge to enroll, but donations are accepted. Past State Deputy John Kasper of Wilson, Kansas is the State Chairman of the Father McGivney Guild.

Through the example of his life and virtue may we follow your Son, Jesus Christ, more closely, fulfilling his commandment of charity and building up his Body which is the Church. Let the inspiration of your servant prompt us to greater confidence in your love so that we may continue his work of caring for the needy and the outcast. We humbly ask that you glorify your servant Father Michael J. McGivney on earth according to the design of your holy will. Through his intercession, grant the favor I now present (here make your request). Through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
